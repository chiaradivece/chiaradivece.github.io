  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel pipeline designed to bring ultrasound (US) plane pose estimation closer to clinical use for more effective navigation to the standard planes (SPs) in the fetal brain. We propose a semi-supervised segmentation model utilizing both labeled SPs and unlabeled 3D US volume slices. Our model enables reliable segmentation across a diverse set of fetal brain images. Furthermore, the model incorporates a classification mechanism to identify the fetal brain precisely. Our model not only filters out frames lacking the brain but also generates masks for those containing it, enhancing the relevance of plane pose regression in clinical settings. We focus on fetal brain navigation from 2D ultrasound (US) video analysis and combine this model with a US plane pose regression network to provide sensorless proximity detection to SPs and non-SPs planes; we emphasize the importance of proximity detection to SPs for guiding sonographers, offering a substantial advantage over traditional methods by allowing earlier and more precise adjustments during scanning. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach through validation on real fetal scan videos obtained from sonographers of varying expertise levels. Our findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to complement existing fetal US technologies and advance prenatal diagnostic practices.},

  abstract = {In obstetric ultrasound (US) scanning, the learner's ability to mentally build a three-dimensional (3D) map of the fetus from a two-dimensional (2D) US image represents a significant challenge in skill acquisition. We aim to build a US plane localization system for 3D visualization, training, and guidance without integrating additional sensors. This work builds on top of our previous work, which predicts the six-dimensional (6D) pose of arbitrarily oriented US planes slicing the fetal brain with respect to a normalized reference frame using a convolutional neural network (CNN) regression network. Here, we analyze in detail the assumptions of the normalized fetal brain reference frame and quantify its accuracy with respect to the acquisition of transventricular (TV) standard plane (SP) for fetal biometry. We investigate the impact of registration quality in the training and testing data and its subsequent effect on trained models. Finally, we introduce data augmentations and larger training sets that improve the results of our previous work, achieving median errors of 2.77 mm and 6.63Â° for translation and rotation, respectively.},

  abstract = {Purpose: In obstetric ultrasound (US) scanning, the learner's ability to mentally build a three-dimensional (3D) map of the fetus from a two-dimensional (2D) US image represents a major challenge in skill acquisition. We aim to build a US plane localisation system for 3D visualisation, training, and guidance without integrating additional sensors. Methods: We propose a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) using image features to estimate the six-dimensional pose of arbitrarily oriented US planes relative to the fetal brain centre. The network was trained on synthetic images acquired from phantom 3D US volumes and fine-tuned on real scans. Training data was generated by slicing US volumes into imaging planes in Unity at random coordinates and more densely around the standard transventricular (TV) plane. Results: With phantom data, the median errors are 0.90 mm/1.17 and 0.44 mm/1.21 for random planes and planes close to the TV one, respectively. With real data, using a different fetus with the same gestational age (GA), these errors are 11.84 mm/25.17. The average inference time is 2.97 ms per plane. Conclusion: The proposed network reliably localises US planes within the fetal brain in phantom data and successfully generalises pose regression for an unseen fetal brain from a similar GA as in training. Future development will expand the prediction to volumes of the whole fetus and assess its potential for vision-based, freehand US-assisted navigation when acquiring standard fetal planes.},
