Hey there! 

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University College London with the Surgical Robot Vision research group. I\'m working on a training system for autonomous navigation and guidance in freehand obstetric ultrasound scans exploiting vision-based deep reinforcement learning. 

Previously I worked as a graduate research intern at the NEARLab (NeuroEngineering And medical Robotic Lab) of Politecnico di Milano. 

I graduated cum laude in December 2019 in Biomedical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (thesis: \"Improvement of Psychomotor Skills Development for Veress Needle Placement using Haptics and Virtual Reality\", NEARLab) and in February 2020 at Alta Scuola Politecnica (project: \"THERALIGHT: Lightwave Technologies for Theranostic of Tumors\").

I\'ve received my Master of Science in Bioengineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in August 2019 (double degree program between Politecnico di Milano and UIC); the work was developed in collaboration with the Mixed Reality Laboratory and the UR*Laboratory of the Innovation Center at UIC. I\'ve also worked at UIC as a Teaching Assistant for the Biological Systems Analysis course in the Bioengineering Department.

I\'ve received my B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering (July 2017) from Politecnico di Milano, discussing my B.Sc. thesis entitled “FPGA-based system for Brain Injury evaluation through pupillometry” developed at the NECSTLab (Novel, Emerging Computing System Technologies Laboratory) of Politecnico di Milano.

Dive into my research papers and publications for a deeper look into my scientific contributions on the [publications page](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=CStrr20AAAAJ&view_op=list_works).

I\'m always open to collaboration and inquiries. Reach out to me at: chiara(dot)divece(dot)20@ucl(dot)ac(dot)uk
